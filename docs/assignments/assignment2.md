# A2: Divergent Design

## App Name: Red Circle

## Description

A virtual hotspot for patients of any diagnosis to share experiences, discuss treatment goals, and form connections.

## Value

Many patients report feeling isolated or not understood due to the severity or uncommon nature of their diagnoses, or otherwise because of lack of access to other patients of similar experiences they can interact with. This app seeks to encompass welcoming spaces for patients of every known condition, diagnosis, and emotional need to foster a wholesome and productive environment for their peace of mind and discussion of best treatment practices.

## Feature Ideas

1.	Qualitative support group selection: Support groups can be formed oriented toward supporting patients with specific diagnoses and hardships. They can be further filtered and selected according to various traits such as the age, geographic location, severity of experience, and medical options of members.

2.	Diagnosis profile timeline: Users can the option to illustrate the time at which they began seeking medical attention for their affliction, when they were subsequently diagnosed, and similar details regarding their current and future status.

3.	Treatment plan suggestion board: Collaborative charts in which users contribute treatment options that a user can undertake after consulting a medical professional, or smaller changes in routine that have helped them. Factors such as cost, time investment, and popularity can be dynamically illustrated with icons.

4.	Quick chat: Facilitate chatroom-style conversations where users can interact briefly but have an option to sustain the connection. This can be specifically catered to the patient userbase by allowing users to filter chat selections by diagnosis, symptoms, and medical experiences.

5.	Medical research feed: Users can subscribe to receive updates on disease and treatment research and potentially AI-powered analysis on how given findings might affect their own lives. Significant breakthroughs in research could also be displayed with greater publicity to the userbase.

6.	HIPAA-centered profiling: Guidelines can be established to users to encourage how they should disclose details in their profiles, and anonymity in various aspects will be openly serviced so patients do not have to disclose sensitive information. Moderation can also be introduced to this aspect to ensure safety.

7.	Health status: Users can display their relative state of well-being at a given time on their profile, which can be personalized to only display to certain groups. Selecting a status below some threshold might notify members of a group.

8.	Inspiration panel: Users can access patient stories in written and video form and inspirational media regarding how patients overcame obstacles in their journey. Users might also be incentivized to submit their own stories.

9.	Therapy reference chart: Recommend therapy options to patients who wish to seek them. The recommendations can employ survey information to best cater to the experiences of the patient.

10.	Mental health channel: Supply pages with support resources and real-time group conversations where users can express mental health concerns. Anonymous interaction will be openly available here.

11.	Hospital review forum: A space to read and write patient experiences at various hospital locations. Experiences might be rated on a scale and given a description of what went well and what may have not, etc.

12.	Hospital review map: The hospital review forum could potentially be accompanied by a map that links each written hospital location with a visual representation relative to the user’s location.

13.	Helper leaderboard: Use a contribution algorithm to rank users who send the most helpful or guiding advice and medical resources to other patients. The leaderboard can reset after a fixed time and might contain multipliers for cycling medical-based themes.

14.	Motivational quote notifications: Since patients might experience emotional obstacles, users could opt in to receive regular motivational quotes to better their mood. The quotes could be personalized to their medical symptoms and could generally be medical-themed as well.

15.	Health journaling: Users can access a daily page where they can make multiple timestamped entries logging their physical health, data, and symptoms. They can further make note of their emotional or mental health and share any of these insights with others.

16.	Condition FAQ panels: Patients can contribute to frequently asked question panels describing their common experiences and answering input questions often wondered. This panel can be readily accessed when someone is curious about a specific condition they encounter on the app.

17.	Medication reminder notifications: Using personal profile information, the app can push notifications to remind and encourage users to take needed medication. These needs can be customized by days and times to accommodate different medicines.

18.	User milestone announcements: Users can set goals according to their personal health aspirations, and these goals might be reflected on their profile. When users achieve specific goals, this might be announced to close friends or displayed on their profile with unique icons.

19.	Mutual goal collaboration: Patients in shared groups or diagnostic groups can share goals that might benefit them collectively. These goals might be individual to everyone or a compiled goal that can be contributed to unevenly.

20.	In-app pharmacy access: patients who have prescriptions and need them ordered/renewed can access pharmacies through the app. There will be guidelines in place to discourage exploring options without consulting a medical professional.

21.	Appointment calendar: in part of the effort to concentrate a patients’ social and medical needs on the platform, the availability of an appointment calendar can be added. Through this calendar, users can interact and suggest visits to clinics and practitioners which can be scheduled collaboratively.


## VSD Analysis


• When considering Non-Targeted Use for Stakeholders, we can imagine malicious use cases in attempts to associate patient data with attempts at matching patient names. For this reason, features like HIPAA-centered profiling, health journaling, and the inspiration panel may be better paired with additional information submission to moderation tools that search for possible links between patient public information and private details and rejects information publishing in the case of a safety violation.

• In perspective of The Long Now for Time, we might observe that five years from now, the focus of app use shifts to a greater audience as a wider span of generations become aware of its utility. Ten or fifteen years from now and further, we might notice a new generation shift away from casual social media use, so this might require chat and social features to be prioritized toward non-social utility

• For Diverse Geographies in Pervasiveness, a major consideration is regions with limited access to medical care, decreasing viability for treatment plan suggestions and group discussions. It might be important to expand servers to increase diversity and encourage holistic suggestions, or conversely specialize content output and group chat design to prompt goals that can be achieved feasibly in a given region.

• With Values and Value Tensions, we see tensions between sharing information for greater relatability versus greater danger to safety and privacy (profiling can be secured), promoted services and accessibility for resources against risk of misuse and lack of professional consultation (moderation and warnings for suggestions), and providing a means for healthy interaction while risking some forms of social isolation due the virtual nature of the platform (chats could foster more means for in-person socialization).

• Considering Environmental Sustainability under Values, features such as in-app pharmacy access could encourage greater rates of delivery service and greater transmissions of fossil fuels into the atmosphere. To counter this, the app might build in messages that will encourage able patients to travel by foot to reach nearby pharmacies and generally promote walking as a safe and sustainable means for exercise when applicable.
