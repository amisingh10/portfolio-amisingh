# A1: Social Media Needfinding

## Hunch:

I speculate that recent college graduates who are entering the work field are being exposed to a new social landscape, with many of them uniquely entering the workspace after experiencing social disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic in their college years – this very well may hold detrimental effects on many of their opportunities to network and connect compared to the past. I would like to explore how social media might be better tailored to appeal to them due to this newly emerging situation.

## Selecting Interviewees:

Completing one’s undergraduate education is by no means an indication of where exactly they will continue for potential further education or career development, but for the purposes of this exploration we should seek participants who have started to work in their prospective careers for at least 1-2 years since their graduation from college. Personally, I am aspiring to complete my education for a future career in software development, so I started by interviewing a participant from a different field in engineering who has already worked in the industry after graduating in 2022.

Imanol is a 23-year-old research and development engineer working in Arcadia, California. He has contributed to various smaller engineering projects prior to his current job where he is developing catheters and similar medical technology for hospital use.

I was interested in interviewing Imanol particularly because his career path is an example of beginning his industry work as soon as he was able to after his undergraduate education in mechanical engineering, which is similar to my own expected trajectory. It seemed to represent a good example of “jumping into” industry and I wished to explore how that might change or preserve habits and expectations associated with the use of social media.

Following this, I interviewed 23-year-old Zoë, who is currently a clinical research coordinator in Baltimore, Maryland. Zoë completed her bachelor’s degree in 2022, but her path is quite different in an important way. Because Zoë aspires to practice medicine and is currently taking gap years as she applies to medical school, she is working in a clinical environment full time, but she plans to do this temporarily until she is admitted into medical school. I was very curious to see how this might contribute to her own use patterns of social media because it represents a middle-ground between beginning a professional career but also likely returning to an educational environment in the near future.

## Questions and Conversation Starters:

Some of the most important questions I wish to learn about are:

1.	How has your routine developed or changed since starting a career? How have you been led up to this since college?
2.	Please describe what you do for work and how that environment looks!
3.	How has your social environment changed or not changed after completing undergrad and starting your job?
4.	How have your opportunities to relax changed or remained the same between this transition?
5.	Please describe how you use social media platforms!
6.	Do you think you achieve what you originally seek from these apps when you first turn to them for use?
7.	How do you like to invest your free time? How much of that is social activity?
8.	How has your social activity changed since graduating? Has any of it been accompanied by changes in social media use?
9.	*Anticipate follow-ups on career, association with coworkers/social media
10.	*Anticipate follow-ups on how much social media use might be invested in career-related topics
11.	*Flow conversation in the direction of describing their background and daily work, asking questions about their platform use and social interactions based on responses

## Interview Report: Imanol

Imanol has experienced considerable consistency between college and engineering work when it comes to the nature of the spare time he spends for entertainment outside of his busy hours. Interestingly, he often separates much of his socialization in these settings from the groups he will spend time with on his own, mentioning that “[e]ven in college, I didn’t really go out with college people, but went to the movies with my friends from high school.” He went on to describe much of his preferred pastime involving video games at home and casually browsing Instagram and X “for funny videos and to see what’s poppin’ on the news” when he is not working out at the gym, and he is happy to “find a lot of variety in this schedule to keep it interesting” even when the day itself is very consistent. A key takeaway I’ve developed from this is that the consistency of Imanol’s schedule after graduating college has allowed him to maintain his use of social media as a simple tool for passing time, but an interesting tension is his disapproval of the occasional loss of time spent when not finding “lots of good videos back-to-back, so sometimes the algorithm gets thrown off by bad stuff.” 

Even with his steady routine, Imanol occasionally looks forward to going out with his coworkers, for instance having gone to a Dodger’s game to wish a coworker farewell for a temporary leave to Korea. When gaming to socialize, he uses Discord as a platform as well but was insistent that “it ain’t a social media, you don’t really call iMessage social media and Discord is kind of the same thing.” It seems important to note from these use cases that Imanol tends to set aside what he considers social media for a half-efficient search for entertaining videos which can often be tainted by irrelevant outputs from the algorithm, which seems to be a very interesting concept to explore!


## Interview Report: Zoë

Zoë has quite the integrated approach to her socialization now that she is in a professional environment – she particularly notes that she is “pretty extroverted, I’ll make friends with whoever” and she naturally gravitates toward those she spends more time working with. Even so, Zoë is not a big fan of the “approximately 9-to-5” structure of her temporary work. She mentions it is quite exhausting for her and notably, “[h]aving a real 9-to-5 you have to plan your casual relax time – you have to make dinner, go to the gym, and that’s your whole evening.” When she does spend on social media, she describes most of her content as “purely inane, [and] none of it has any… [value]. It’s brain rot.” It is observable here that Zoë resorts to TikTok, X, and Instagram mainly to zone out from her day and that seems to be an important takeaway about its value as a destressing factor in her busy routine. Even so, an interesting tension within this is that she acknowledges that “90% of the time I’m looking for funny things and 10% of the time is actually looking AT funny things, and I’m chronically online.” 

Although she considers only about “0.5%” of the content she explores to be relevant to her job, Zoë has one very powerful passion that she explores casually through social media – her interest in practicing trans-medicine. She mentions “always want[ing] to be in medicine, period,” but related research in this field is done “poorly on vulnerable populations” and she wants to take part in improving this research. She has found social media to greatly inform her knowledge of these issues through narratives, one of the most memorable being her friend being at risk of denied care on the basis of being transgender due to now-repealed 2020 policy that put them at risk during medical emergencies from allergies. It was incredible to hear how powerfully Zoë was engaged upon encountering this content even when it was not her primary use case!


## 3 Design Opportunities:

•	Content Categories: posted content should be strictly classified into categories that can be opened in tabs and scrolled, perhaps broader ones representing fields like “humor,” “news,” “dance,” “art,” and more, and even subcategories that further specify content that users might be interested in. This would probably greatly boost time efficiency in seeking specific types of content. We observed from both Imanol and Zoë that spending time searching for content that was considered of entertaining value was a common issue encountered, with Zoë even describing this process as taking up 90% of the scrolling. Further, this could assist with temporary switches in mood such as learning about more stories for passions like Zoë’s for trans-medicine or Imanol’s for working out at the gym. Further, categories that are not of interest could be disabled for any desired time or listed as “not preferred” for mixed viewership use cases.

•	Controlled Content Volume: a phenomenon often described as doomscrolling results from continually consuming negative or otherwise uninteresting content for an extended period of time; Imanol particularly mentioned that “well yeah, I think a lot of us would try to use the time better if we weren’t scrolling.” Naturally, part of this issue is having more content available to scroll, and perhaps an interesting design choice to combat this is having a limited array of options to customize bursts of content rather than a continuous stream. With this design, a user might only receive, for example, 10 quality reels to scroll for a given 1-hour window. Taking into account Zoë’s experience of having to sometimes go so far as scheduling out her relaxation time, this could help reduce overwhelming options by incentivizing small windows of time online and more time spent connecting elsewhere.

•	Added Customization for Relaxation: whereas social platforms might be commonly found to be stressful or full of sometimes emotional content, these platforms could better capitalize on features to maximize and customize the users’ visual and audio experiences to provide soothing background noise, many relaxing choices of lighting, moving screens, unique designs, varied transitions, and even user interfaces that present either more or less content as desired by the user. This will bring the focus of the platform away from just throwing content at the user more toward providing a pleasant and productive aesthetic experience, which might even serve to reduce the users’ need to spend unsatisfied and unentertained time on the platform. While both interviewees mention social media as a means to relax from their day, we also see Zoë mention that the overloaded and full-of-ideas component of these apps is precisely what allows her to zone out for the time being, so this can be engineering to be presented even more soothingly with many aesthetic customizations.

c.	I’m pretty extroverted, I’ll make friends with whoever
d.	People at work with most time spent are the ones she gravitates toward

4.	Can we return to that mention of an approximate 9-to-5, How do you think that level of structure affects your energy and ability to relax after the day?
a.	Finds it very exhausting, and you have to make dinner, go to the gym, and that’s your whole evening. Having a real 9-to-5 you have to plan in your casal relax time
b.	Endurance is tiring, planning for the workday and other things

5.	With relax time, let’s talk social media. Discuss most frequent platforms – a lot of time on tiktok and twitter, Instagram second place
a.	Divide that space  - purely inane, none of it has any… [value], brainrot, gets stuff with news catered towards you, is a politically informed person

d.	How much of the time is spent looking for entertaining things, mostly spent looking 90% to 10% of the time.
e.	How much related to the job? A solid 0.5%, why not interested? The type of content you are looking for does not match professional stuff, “I’m trying to laugh!”

6.	Zoë follows up by mentioning: coworkers on private story Instagram
a.	How do you spend time with coworkers outside of work? Make plans but they will never happen, similar career path, very limited free time
b.	How does that compare to your time in undergrad? Very social in undergrad, did work together, 99% of the time with somebody else very social person. Not doing homework around friends vs. being at office with 2 middle-aged ladies “who kinda scare me”
c.	Definitely had fun, was really bored, would spend a lot of time going out
d.	50/50 when doing work, when not, culture at Hopkins of need to be working 24/7
i.	Note: *Relatable for a lot of high-intensity schools or career paths where there is a particular emphasis on academic performance! Could be important to explore
e.	Spent a lot of time hammocking, hung out a lot and got ourselves into situations

7.	Talking more about your friend, group how did you meet and kick things off together?
a.	Freshman year is very turbulent full of social change, integrating so many people, social group was based upon new people clicked with in early college because of COVID-19 pandemic
b.	Tell me more about why it stayed that way! She tends to make friends because of activities done, didn’t really start new activities at that time
c.	Going on phone to think less, not so overwhelmed when there is so much stuff, it takes away overwhelmed feeling from life spend too much time and now stressed out when a lot of time has passed
d.	Overwhelmed when there is a big political crisis
e.	Tries to shut off from things for a bit

a.	Influenced by election seasons and “since COVID nothing has been apolitical”
b.	Wanted to work with transmedicine to help with aging transpeople deal with medicare
c.	**More focused interest on transmedicine as becoming online, “always wanted to be in medicine period, but research has revealed how much you don’t know and how poorly research was done on vulnerable populations”
d.	How has that become or not become a focus for you when browsing? Not a focus because she engages with a lot of media, spend too much time on phone and liking stupid things, make me laugh and feel better about life, “it is what it is”
e.	Observed flaws in a system without direct experiences, “my view of medicine and healthcare is pretty progressive,” “reparative historization” (*accounting for what has happened to people in the past and how to use that correctively by people who didn’t have a say in the matter, taking back agency critically) with medicine progress not linear at different rates, associated with certain bodies

9.	How has social media contributed to witnessing these flaws specifically?
a.	Best way to learn from that is through people’s stories, people who are willing to talk about it on social media are better sources of information
b.	Not content you directly go out of your way to search for but are fed that content from algorithm (**relevant to 8d. as well, seems to be a strong passion that evokes emotions but not explicitly sought out on social media)
c.	Could you provide an example of this you might remember? In 2020 Trump administration had taken away protections for people who identified as trans denying care, personally affected, one of closest friends has severe nut allergies and could be denied care
d.	There are no longer administrative practices that prevent discrimination on trans people, it was repealed
e.	Please elaborate on your emotions and reaction to this situation! Was taken aback by the whole situation, approaches life in a very authentic way and even not just not having a friend knowing that somebody could be dying, was straight angry at the fact that that’s even possible with how the system is set up, can’t change the engrained past and all we can do is move forward
